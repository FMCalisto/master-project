\section{Abstract}

Mammography is the primary method of image diagnosis used for screening and diagnosis of breast cancer, with an embodiment recommended image in several countries like Europe and the United States to use in screening programs. The implementation of digital technology caused changes in the practice of mammography, including the need to adapt quality control programs.

Our goal with this report is to start to characterising the current mammography technology in Portugal and practices in their use by professionals health involved. Finish on the level of harmonisation of practices in mammography in Portugal and compliance with international recommendations. Identify opportunities for optimisation to ensure the use of effectiveness and technologically safe.

The methodology followed here was the research and data collection on technology deployed, provided by government sources, mammography service providers and industry. Construction of surveys, oriented to the profile of radiologist physicians and some others clinical specialities with activity in digital mammography. The surveys were applied in providers selected as mammography services based on geographically location criteria, type of technology installed and profile of the institution.

\section{Introduction}

The technology for breast imaging has been the subject of major developments in the last decade with several multi-modalities (MRI and Ultrasound) to currently play a major role in disease breast management. Mammography (image produced with X-rays) is the main method used in the screening and Diagnosis of Breast Cancer signals, keeping the recommended imaging multi-modality for use in screening programs in several countries in Europe and the USA. The mammography limitations are known, specifically their limited specificity sensitivity and in the detection and characterisation of lesions, particularly in dense breasts and in young women. Studies on the effectiveness of the mammogram in women over 50 indicate sensitivity values between 68\% and 90\% and variable specificity between 82\% and 97\%.

The value of Ultrasonography (US) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is recognised as a complement to mammography. Computed Tomography (CT), Positron Emission Mammography (PEM) and Breast Scintigraphy (SPECT) are methods also used in the diagnosis and evaluation of breast pathology.

Digital technology mammography effectiveness has been proven in several clinical studies the last decade. Currently there are several options commercially available for digital mammography differ the detector characteristics acquisition system and image processing and its integration with source X-Ray.

In this report we intend to disclose some figures relating to clinical collaboration in the project and its objectives, showing preliminary results of the characterisation of the installed technology activities in the evaluated institutions and ongoing practices as a physicians sample.

It is an overall of the report objective to conclude on the level of harmonisation of practices in mammography in this physicians sample and study compliance with the international recommendations/guidelines. It also intends to identify opportunities to promote the quality of mammograms.

\section{Surveys}

Throughout the survey development were emerging doubts that prompted questions about points that would be clogged with the low-fidelity prototype. For a first sample of reasonability and report the quality of aid has been claimed to Doctor Cristina Ribeiro da Fonseca to help us validate the survey and some of the questions.

This first questionnaire will be used to characterise the user of a mammography imaging multimodality interface being carried out in the framework of an innovative interface for monitoring and diagnosis of breast lesions and various medical imaging modalities. The questionnaire takes about 10 minutes and is divided into 9 short phases.

The first part is a simple description of what is the project and what the objectives to face are on the rest of the project.

Second part is made to understand the Doctor's profile where we ask questions like sex, age, etc. It is also in this section we try to understand a little of the professional profile that most mammography professionals have and in this way is questioned how long are medical functions prosecute, which sectors where the doctor works in that infrastructure and finally what specialty.

In the third part we characterise the clinical captivity by questions about it, the technological preferences, the clinical practice and its support for visualisation, tools, technologies and software of its medical units.

The fourth section aims to help us understand that training has the doctors working in the field. Asking if they have some kind of training in digital mammography and their views given the need to update knowledge in digital mammography and mammography certification in Portugal.
