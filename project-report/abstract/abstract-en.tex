This report belongs to Medical Imaging Multimodality Breast Cancer Diagnosis User Interface (MIMBCD-UI) state of the art project stage, describing the related work of Clinical User Interfaces.

Breast cancer is an abnormal growth of cells in the breast, usually in the inner lining of the milk ducts or lobules. It is currently the most common type of cancer in women in developed and developing countries. The number of women affected by breast cancer is gradually increasing and remains as a significant health concern.

Researchers are continuously working to develop novel techniques to detect early stages of breast cancer. This project proposes the development of a methodology for detection and cancer targeting breast using multimodality medical imaging and textual information.
