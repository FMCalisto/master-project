    abstract = {{Most current designs of information technology are based on the notion of supporting distinct tasks such as document production, email usage, and voice communication. In this paper we present empirical results that suggest that people organize their work in terms of much larger and thematically connected units of work. We present results of fieldwork observation of information workers in three different roles: analysts, software developers, and managers. We discovered that all of these types of workers experience a high level of discontinuity in the execution of their activities. People average about three minutes on a task and somewhat more than two minutes using any electronic tool or paper document before switching tasks. We introduce the concept of working spheres to explain the inherent way in which individuals conceptualize and organize their basic units of work. People worked in an average of ten different working spheres. Working spheres are also fragmented; people spend about 12 minutes in a working sphere before they switch to another. We argue that design of information technology needs to support people's continual switching between working spheres.}},

"...people are acting in many contexts beyond work...To manage all these activities, people deploy a diverse assemblage of both digital and nondigital technologies in offices, homes, public spaces, and mobile contexts. ...the conceptual apparatus of activity theory currently does not provide an elaborated set of concepts for the analysis of multiple activities." p. 256

"There is a need to develop analytical tools that can help understand why people at a certain moment select a particular goal and carry out a particular action, why and how they move from one action to another, how they coordinate multiple actions, why they abandon certain goals, and how they develop new objects. It is hardly possible to provide adequate technological support for the coordination, flexibility, and mobility required in modern work and nonwork activities without such an understanding. To meet this challenge of dealing with complex real-life processes, activity theory requires some new concepts. A move is needed from a preoccupation with separate activities to a focus on the complex interplay of several dynamically coordinated activities. Research methodologies that make it possible to study multiple activities empirically are also needed." [this paper amongst others] might be points of departure for the development of such a methodology. p. 257},
